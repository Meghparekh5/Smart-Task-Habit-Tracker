📚 About This Project

This project is a simple and smooth Image Slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s made to be easy to understand, easy to edit, and small enough to fit into any website without extra setup or libraries.

🎯 What It Offers

🖼️ Shows one image at a time

🎛️ Includes controls to move forward, backward, play, or pause

⏱️ Can automatically switch images like a slideshow

📱 Fully responsive — works on phones, tablets, and desktops

🔧 Easy to customize — just replace image links or adjust timing

🧠 How It Works (Simple Logic)

All images are loaded on the page, but only one is visible.

The script keeps track of the current image number.

When buttons are pressed or autoplay is on, it switches the visible image.

The slider simply hides old images and shows the next one — clean and simple.

The timing, images, and controls can be changed easily if needed.

🛠️ Customization Tips

✏️ To change images → update the <img src="..."> links

⏳ To change speed → edit the number in setInterval(next, 2000)

🎨 To style buttons → edit the button CSS section
